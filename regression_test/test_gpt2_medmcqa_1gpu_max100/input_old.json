Glycogen synthesisLow insulin to glucagon ratio implies a catabolic state, i.e. usage of body stores to form energy, typically seen in fasting state ancl diabetes mellitus. Hence, this state will promote glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis as well as ketone body formation, while at the same time inhibiting glycogen synthesis and storage."

Antero inferior pa is supplied by SUPERIOR LABIAL AERY - branch of facial aery, which is branch of EXTERNAL CAROTID AERY. Postero superior pa is supplied by SPHENO-PALATINE AERY - branch of MAXILLARY aery, which is branch of ECA. POSTERO INFERIOR pa is supplied by branches of GREATER PALATINE AERY - branch of ECA Antero inferior pa/vestibule of septum contain anastomosis b/w septal ramus of superior labial branch of facial aery & branches of sphenopalatine, greater palatine & anterior ethmoidal aeries.
